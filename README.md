# Plant-health-monitoring-using-ml
Plant health monitoring uses machine learning to analyze plant parameters like chlorophyll, nitrogen, and soil moisture. It classifies plant health into **Healthy, Moderate Stress, or Stressed** to help farmers take action. The system predicts plant conditions using input data and provides insights for better crop management. ðŸŒ±ðŸ“Š



# Plant Health Monitoring using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to monitor and assess plant health using machine learning techniques. It utilizes various plant parameters such as chlorophyll content, nitrogen, potassium, humidity, soil moisture, and electrochemical properties to classify plant health conditions. The system can help farmers and gardeners identify issues early and take appropriate action.

## Features
- **Data-based plant health classification** (Chlorophyll, Nitrogen, Potassium, Humidity, Soil Moisture, Electrochemical properties, etc.)
- **Classification of plant health into three categories: Healthy, Moderate Stress, and Stressed**
- **User-friendly interface for inputting plant parameters**
- **Machine learning model for prediction**
- **Data visualization for insights**

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- pip
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-health-monitoring.git
   cd plant-health-monitoring
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Download the trained model (if required) and place it in the `models/` directory.

## Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Enter plant parameter values such as chlorophyll, nitrogen, potassium, humidity, soil moisture, and electrochemical properties.
4. Click **Predict** to classify the plant health status as **Healthy, Moderate Stress, or Stressed**.

### Example Input Data
| Plant ID | Chlorophyll | Nitrogen | Potassium | Humidity (%) | Soil Moisture (%) | Electrochemical Properties |
|----------|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 101      | 45.2       | 3.1      | 2.8       | 60           | 25                | 0.87                      |
| 102      | 30.5       | 2.0      | 1.5       | 50           | 18                | 0.72                      |
| 103      | 20.8       | 1.2      | 0.8       | 40           | 12                | 0.55                      |
